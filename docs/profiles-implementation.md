# Profile implementation

## Target and ownership

Profiles compose an empty plugin tree using ordered bundle layers, profile operations,
machine overrides and launch overrides. The interpretation is shared with Cordis Include.
Cordis owns generic composition and tree lifecycle. Kcode owns named profiles, package
resolution, data scopes, persistence, agent-turn boundaries and native management UI.

Portable definitions contain data only. Module allocation and ConfigValidator execution
belong to activation. Package IDs and entry IDs are separate identities. Bundle references
are versioned; unknown targets produce diagnostics rather than silently changing intent.

## Isolated development

- Kcode branch: `meteor/profiles`, managed worktree `kcode-profiles`.
- Cordis branch: `meteor/profile-composition`, sibling worktree `cordis-kotlin-profiles`.
- Build Kcode against the Cordis worktree using `-PcordisSource=<absolute path>`.
- Keep validation and commits at phase boundaries.

## Phases

1. Shared detached composition, patch diagnostics and sources; portable Profile models.
2. Observable transactional tree updates and Include candidate publication.
3. Profile repository, immutable package locks, generation commits and migration.
4. Default bundles, host selection and runtime application/switching.
5. Profile management, preview, import/export and host recovery UI.
6. Cross-platform package/lifecycle checks and user documentation.

## Outstanding invariants

Phase-one validation passed: Cordis `:include:jvmTest` (14 tests), Kcode
`:plugins:profiles:desktopTest` (4 tests), using the Cordis composite source build.
No host or instrumentation validation has been claimed at this stage.

Do not equate a successful Include refresh with a product-level transaction. Cordis's
legacy EntryGroup update logs individual errors; strict transactional application is
still required. Candidate content must not replace committed content before success.
Persistent generations need one atomic commit point across definition, lock and runtime
snapshot; multiple sequential file renames are not a transaction.

Active agent turns must finish or be explicitly cancelled before application. Different
profiles switch by runtime shutdown/recreation initially. Durable provider data survives
withdrawal. Credentials and host paths do not belong in exported profile definitions.

Completion requires all phases, migration tests, real package loading evidence, desktop
and Android build validation and documentation. Phase-one tests alone are not completion.
